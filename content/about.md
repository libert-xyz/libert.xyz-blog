##### Hey there, Iâ€™m Libert,

and I work as a consultant that specializes in introducing a DevOps culture in teams and building cost effective Cloud Computing solutions.


Software controls the world we live in, from the moment that we order our favorite coffee to the moment that we take a plane, I'm really exited to be part of this revolution and help future companies to build new solutions to traditional problems.
