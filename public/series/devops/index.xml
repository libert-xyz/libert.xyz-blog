      <description>DevOps has many definitions and nobody seems to agree on a single term.
It gets more confusing when looking for DevOps Engineers job descriptions, you don&amp;rsquo;t know if they are looking for a System Administrator or a Full-Stack Engineer.
Developers like to build software and test things quickly, whereas System Administrators focus on stability and reliability. In my experience merging both roles in a single one is what a DevOps Engineer is.</description>
