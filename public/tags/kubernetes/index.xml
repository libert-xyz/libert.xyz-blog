      <description>Inter-pod networking Networking is one of the most complex pieces in Kubernetes, let&amp;rsquo;s try to summarize pod networking and apply the divide and conquer paradigm.
 Each pod gets its own unique IP address. Each pod can communicate with all other pods through a flat, NATless network.  How Kubernetes does it? The networking is set up by the System Administrator or by a Container Network Interace (CNI) plugin.</description>
